<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	In the depictive construction the AdjP version is required (<em>He remained <u>asleep</u></em> / *<em><u>in sleep</u></em>) unless appropriate dependents are added (<em>He remained in a deep sleep)</em>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p>	There is a different sense of <em>come </em>(roughly act as though one were) where it does take an NP complement, as in <em>Don't come the concerned father with me</em>.

<p>#326| [1]		i		NP function:	NPs are prototypically capable, when placed in an appropriate case-form, of functioning as a complement in clause structure, i.e. as subject (<em><u>The doctor</u> arrived</em>), object (<em>We need <u>a doctor</u></em>) or predicative complement (<em>Kim is <u>a doctor</u></em>).</p>
<p>#326| 	ii		NP structure:	Except in what we refer to as the fused-head construction (<em><u>Two of them</u> were broken</em>,<em> <u>Many</u> would disagree</em>,<em> It benefits <u>the rich</u></em>), NPs consist of a noun as head, alone or accompanied by one or more dependents.</p>
<p>#326| [2]		i		inflection.	Nouns prototypically inflect for number (singular vs plural) and for case (plain vs genitive).</p>
<p>#326| 	ii		function.	Nouns characteristically function as head in NP structure.</p>
<p>#326| 	iii		dependents.	Various dependents occur exclusively or almost exclusively with nouns as head: certain determinatives (<em><u>a</u> book</em>, <em><u>every</u> day</em>), pre-head AdjPs (<em><u>good</u> news</em>), relative clauses (<em>people <u>who work</u></em>). Conversely, nouns differ from verbs and prepositions in that they do not take objects: <em>Kim dislikes <u>it</u></em> but not *<em>Kim's dislike <u>it</u></em>.</p>

<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	This example is based on a much-quoted joke attributed to Sir Winston Churchill, who is said to have annotated some clumsy evasion of stranding in a document with the remark: <em>This is the sort of English up with which I will not put</em>. Unfortunately, the joke fails because it depends on a mistaken grammatical analysis: in <em>I will not put up with this sort of English</em> the sequence <em>up with this sort of English </em>is not a constituent, <em>up</em> being a separate complement of the verb (in the traditional analysis it is an adverb). Churchill's example thus does not demonstrate the absurdity of using PP fronting instead of stranding: it merely illustrates the ungrammaticality resulting from fronting something which is not a constituent. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li></ol>

<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	Other terms found in the literature corresponding to our `fused relative (construction) are `free relative', `headless relative clause' and `nominal relative clause'. Terms incorporating `clause' are unsatisfactory for the reasons we have given. In addition, `nominal' is insufficiently general in that it doesn't cater for prepositional examples like those with <em>where</em> or <em>when</em>. And `headless' is misleading in our view since the head of the containing phrase is not missing but fused with part of the modifying clause. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li></ol>
