<p>#326| [1]		i		NP function:	NPs are prototypically capable, when placed in an appropriate case-form, of functioning as a complement in clause structure, i.e. as subject (<em>The doctor arrived</em>), object (<em>We need a doctor</em>) or predicative complement (<em>Kim is a doctor</em>).</p>
<p>#326| 	ii		NP structure:	Except in what we refer to as the fused-head construction (<em>Two of them were broken</em>,<em> Many would disagree</em>,<em> It benefits the rich</em>), NPs consist of a noun as head, alone or accompanied by one or more dependents.</p>
<p>#326| [2]		i		inflection.	Nouns prototypically inflect for number (singular vs plural) and for case (plain vs genitive).</p>
<p>#326| 	ii		function.	Nouns characteristically function as head in NP structure.</p>
<p>#326| 	iii		dependents.	Various dependents occur exclusively or almost exclusively with nouns as head: certain determinatives (<em>a book</em>, <em>every day</em>), pre-head AdjPs (<em>good news</em>), relative clauses (<em>people who work</em>). Conversely, nouns differ from verbs and prepositions in that they do not take objects: <em>Kim dislikes it</em> but not *<em>Kim's dislike it</em>.</p>

<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	This example is based on a much-quoted joke attributed to Sir Winston Churchill, who is said to have annotated some clumsy evasion of stranding in a document with the remark: <em>This is the sort of English up with which I will not put</em>. Unfortunately, the joke fails because it depends on a mistaken grammatical analysis: in <em>I will not put up with this sort of English</em> the sequence <em>up with this sort of English </em>is not a constituent, <em>up</em> being a separate complement of the verb (in the traditional analysis it is an adverb). Churchill's example thus does not demonstrate the absurdity of using PP fronting instead of stranding: it merely illustrates the ungrammaticality resulting from fronting something which is not a constituent. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li></ol>

<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	For many American speakers the expression <em>I couldn't care less</em> has lost its negation and the expression is now <em>I could care less</em>, still with the idiomatic meaning `I do not care at all'. For these speakers, <em>care less</em> is no longer a non-affirmative polarity item; <em>could care less</em> has become an idiom with a negative meaning (approximately the opposite of its literal meaning). This is not an uncommon development; it is seen again in the development from <em>I don't know beans about it</em> I don't know anything about it to <em>I know beans about it</em> with the same meaning.  <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p>	<em>No way</em> can also be integrated into clause structure as an emphatic negator, as in <em>No way is that a diamond!</em> The original manner meaning has here been bleached away, so that we understand That is emphatically not a diamond. <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li></ol>

<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>	Other terms found in the literature corresponding to our `fused relative (construction) are `free relative', `headless relative clause' and `nominal relative clause'. Terms incorporating `clause' are unsatisfactory for the reasons we have given. In addition, `nominal' is insufficiently general in that it doesn't cater for prepositional examples like those with <em>where</em> or <em>when</em>. And `headless' is misleading in our view since the head of the containing phrase is not missing but fused with part of the modifying clause. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li></ol>
